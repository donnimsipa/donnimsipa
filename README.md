I have always been passionate about technology and healthcare, with a strong commitment to learning and contributing to medical advancements. Since my early school years, I have been driven by a curiosity to explore the intersection of these two fields, eager to understand and apply new knowledge.

Key strengths:

An insatiable curiosity and a constant desire to learn;

A strong sense of loyalty, persistence, and responsibility;

A dedication to making meaningful contributions to healthcare and technology studies.
